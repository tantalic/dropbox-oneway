# `tantalic.com/dropbox`

A simple, incomplete [Dropbox API v2][db-api] client in [Go][go].

## Features

The client is intentionally kept simple and only implements features actively being used for my needs. This currently includes:

- Listing files in a directory
- Watching a directory for changes
- Downloading files
